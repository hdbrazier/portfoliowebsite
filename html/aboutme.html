        <h2>A little about me</h2>
        <p>I was born in England and raised in Spain, on the mediterranean coast in a town called Javea.
            I learnt to sail at the yatch club which in turn introduced me to scuba diving. As soon as I turned 18, I jumped on a plane and moved to the Cayman islands to teach diving.
            I always knew I was a little different and was always searching for a new thrill. At the age of 22, I moved to the US, where I settled in Florida. It was here that I enrolled
            in a flight school and learned how to fly helicopters. </p>

        <div class="aboutme">
            I have ran multiple flight schools, teaching people how to fly, I flew for the news channel and then I moved to Las Vegas where I flew tours to the Grand Canyon. 
            The last 2 years, I have been living in Indianapolis where I work for St Vincent Hospital group, flying EMS. Although the schedule can be demanding, it is a great job 
            where I know I am helping people for good.

        <p>
            I am not sure what the future holds for me, I am looking to expand my knowledge and learn a new skill, programming has become a new part of my life and I expect great things to come of it.

            I have a little dog named Nyx, she is a corgi mix that looks like a Jack Russel Terrier.
            She is 11 years old now although that hasn't slowed her down at all.
            I adopted her off the street when she was just 3 weeks old and she has travelled with me since.

            Charlie is my 8 year old cat, I rescued her from a hoarding situation when I lived in Florida, where she was bullied continuosly by the other cats.
            She is extremely loving and demands attention, just not the belly scratches.
